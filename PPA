What is PPA?

PPAs (Personal Package Archives) are for non standard software/updates. 
They are generally used by people who want the latest and greatest. 
If you are going extra lengths to get this kind of software, then you are expected to know what you are doing. 
The selection in the Software Centre is ample for most human beings.

Command Line

add-apt-repository
===================

On the command line you can add a PPA using add-apt-repository, e.g.:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa

To remove a PPA remove the corresponding files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d (this does not remove the packages you installed from the PPA).

If you get an error that the add-apt-repository command could not be found:

On 12.04 and earlier, install the python-software-properties package:
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

On 14.04 and later:
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

apt-get install & apt-get update
===================================

The apt-get utility is a powerful and free package management command line program, 
that is used to work with Ubuntuâ€™s APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) library 
to perform installation of new software packages, removing existing software packages, 
upgrading of existing software packages

app-cache
==========
The apt-cache command line tool is used for searching apt software package cache. 
In simple words, this tool is used to search software packages, 
collects information of packages and also used to search for what 
available packages are ready for installation on Debian or Ubuntu based systems.
